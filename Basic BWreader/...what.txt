Using Pygame
Strictly transform white into ─, 
ltgray into light block,
gray into gray block,
dkgray into strong block,
black into full block.

Half pixels will be halved depending on which one is white for now

Image must have only those 4 colors,
otherwise # will be used.


Transparent cases are not very better (it uses # instead of black outlines)
